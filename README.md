# DD2380 Artificial Intelligence
Two labs from the master course in Artificial Intelligence on KTH, fall 2019

### Tools
**C++** - lab 1 <br/>
**Java** - lab 2

## Lab 1
The main topic of this lab was to firstly implement a ***Hidden Markov model*** from scratch and thereafter apply it to a real world problem (hunt ducks).

We managed to get a score of 507 on duck hunt, where a score of 370 was required to be approved.

## Lab 2
The main topic of this lab was to implement the ***minimax algorithm*** from scratch and create autonomous agents for Tic tac toe (4x4), Tic tac toe 3D (4x4x4) and lastly for Checkers. We also implemented ***alpha beta pruning***, ***iterative deepening*** and ***repeated states checking*** to improve the minimax.
